that optimal episode return is 50, and optimal episode performance is 100

Each agent uses discounting of 0.99 per timestep in order to avoid divergence in the value function. For value function approximation, both agents use a small multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers with 100 nodes each.

We also provide a default reward of âˆ’1 in every time step to encourage finishing the episode sooner rather than later, and use no discounting in the environment (though our agents use discounting as an optimization trick).

The boat race environment in Figure 4 illustrates the problem of a misspecified reward function. It is a simple grid-world implementation of a reward misspecification problem found in the video game CoastRunners (Clark and Amodei, 2016). The agent can steer a boat around a track; and whenever it enters an arrow tile in the direction of the arrow, it gets a reward of 3.

The intended behavior is that the agent completes a lap as fast as possible. The performance is the winding number of the agent around the track (total amount of clockwise motion minus total amount of counter-clockwise motion) within the episode length of 100 time steps. 

The agent can exploit a loophole and get the same amount of reward by moving back and forth on the same arrow-tile, making no progress on the intended goal of driving around the track. One way to understand the issue in this problem is that the reward function is not potential shaped (Ng et al., 1999).
